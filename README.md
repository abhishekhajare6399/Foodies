• The project aims to create a platform similar to Zomato, connecting local hotel restaurants and cafes. 
• Customers can place food orders from multiple restaurants through the platform and avail discounts. 
• A separate admin platform, called "Foodies Admin," is developed for hotels and restaurants to manage their menu lists, customer orders, bills, and order history. 
• The admin platform also provides features to generate sales reports, enabling analysis of food sales and order values for business insights.
